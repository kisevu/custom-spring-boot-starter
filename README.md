*WELCOME TO MY CUSTOM SPRING BOOT JSON PLACEHOLDER STARTER DEPENDENCY*
I have written my own starter dependency and used spring conventions to come up with such a starter.
During its creation I managed to handle the following:
 1 ) I removed the boilerplate codes.
 2 ) Created some properties and some configuration classes.
 3 ) Read configurations file with the imports file inside the resources section which is a convention
 4 ) I have written tests to complement my workings and ensure the correctness of the put configurations and workings
